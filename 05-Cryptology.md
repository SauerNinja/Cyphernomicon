I have credited quotes with a "[Joe Foobar, place, date] attribution, usually at the end of the quote. If a place is not listed, it is the Cypherpunks list itself. The author and date should be sufficient to (someday) retrieve the source text. By the way, I used quotes as they seemed appropriate, and make no claims that the quoted points are necessarily original to the author--who may have remembered them from somewhere else--or that the date listed is the origination date for the point. I have something like 80 megabytes of Cypherpunks posts, so I couldn't do an archaeological dig for the earliest mention of an idea.</p></div></details><details class="chunk depth-3" id="h-20-3-3"><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.3.3</span><span class="chunk-title">People can quote this FAQ under the "fair use" provisions,</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><p class="chunk-lede">e.g., a paragraph or two, with credits.

It is in fact likely that this FAQ will be available as a Web document. My concern, however, is that the integrity and authorship be maintained. Thus, splitting the document in a hundred or more little pieces, with no authorship attached, would not be cool. Also, I intend to maintain this document with my powerful outlining tools (Symantec's "MORE," on a Macintosh) and thus anyone who "freezes" the document and uses it as a base for links, pointers, etc., will be left behind as mods are made.</p></div></details></div></details><details class="chunk depth-2" id="h-20-4" open><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.4</span><span class="chunk-title">A Few Words on the Style</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><details class="chunk depth-3" id="h-20-4-1"><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.4.1</span><span class="chunk-title">Some sections are in outline form</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><ul class="outline"><li>like this</li><li>with fragments of ideas and points</li><li>with incomplete sentences</li><li>and with lists of points that are obviously only starting points for more complete analyses</li></ul></div></details><details class="chunk depth-3" id="h-20-4-2"><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.4.2</span><span class="chunk-title">Other sections are written in more complete essay form, as</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><p class="chunk-lede">reasonably self-contained analyses of some point or topic.

I've tried to clean these up as much as I can, but there will always be some places where an idea seemed clear to me at the time (maybe not) but which is not presented clearly to others. I'll keep trying to iron these kinks out in future versions.</p></div></details><details class="chunk depth-3" id="h-20-4-5"><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.4.5</span><span class="chunk-title">Comment on style</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><ul class="outline"><li>In many cases I merged two or more chunks of ideas into one section, resulting in many cases in mismatching writing styles, tenses, etc. I apologize, but I just don't have the many dozens of hours it might take to go through and "regularize" things, to write more graceful transition paragraphs, etc. I felt it was more important to get the ideas and idea fragments out than to polish the writing. (Essays written from scratch, and in order, are generally more graceful than are concatenations of ideas, facts, pointers, and the like.)</li><li>Readers should also not assume that a "fleshed-out" section, made up of relatively complete paragraphs, is any more important than a section that is still mostly made up of short one-liners.</li><li>References to Crypto Journals, Books. Nearly every section in this document _could have_ one or more references to articles and papers in the Crypto Proceedings, in Schneier's book, or whatever. Sorry, but I can't do this. Maybe someday--when true hypertext arrives and is readily usable (don't send me e-mail about HTML, or Xanadu, etc.) this kind of cross-referencing will be done. Footnotes would work today, but are distracting in on-line documents. And too much work, given that this is not meant to be a scholarly thesis.</li><li>I also have resisted the impulse to included quotes or sections from other FAQs, notably the sci.crypt and rsadsi FAQs. No point in copying their stuff, even with appropriate credit. Readers should already have these docs, of course.</li></ul></div></details><details class="chunk depth-3" id="h-20-4-6"><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.4.6</span><span class="chunk-title">quibbling</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><ul class="outline"><li>Any time you say something to 500-700 people, expect to have a bunch of quibbles. People will take issue with phrasings, with choices of definitions, with facts, etc. Correctness is important, but sometimes the quibbling sets off a chain reaction of corrections, countercorrections, rebuttals, and "I would have put it differently"s. It's all a bit overwhelming at times. My hope for this FAQ is that serious errors are (of course) corrected, but that the List not get bogged down in endless quibbling about such minor issues as style and phrasing.</li></ul></div></details></div></details><details class="chunk depth-2" id="h-20-5" open><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.5</span><span class="chunk-title">How to Find Information</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><details class="chunk depth-3" id="h-20-5-1"><summary><span class="chunk-num">20.5.1</span><span class="chunk-title">This FAQ is very long, which makes finding specific questions</span></summary><div class="chunk-body"><p class="chunk-lede">problematic.
